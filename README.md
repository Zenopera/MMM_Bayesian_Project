# Bayesian Marketing Mix Modeling

## Overview
This project applies Bayesian Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) to analyze the impact of advertising, pricing, and competitor activities on sales performance in the fiber-optic telecommunications industry. The goal is to provide a robust, probabilistic approach to optimize marketing budget allocation.

## Solution Approach
We developed and tested three different Bayesian models to address the challenges of traditional MMM:

- **Model 1**: Utilizes Fourier basis functions to capture seasonality in sales trends.
- **Model 2**: Implements a Gaussian Process (GP) to model time-varying advertising effectiveness.
- **Model 3**: Combines Fourier basis and Gaussian Process for a more comprehensive representation of seasonal and dynamic effects.

Each model incorporates non-linear transformations to account for diminishing returns on advertising spend and carryover effects over time.

## Repository Contents
